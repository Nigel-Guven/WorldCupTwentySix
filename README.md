World Cup 2026 Simulator (C++)
Welcome to the World Cup 2026 Simulator! This project is a C++ program designed to simulate the FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament using multiple randomized game modes. The simulator takes into account the current FIFA international team rankings and employs advanced data structures such as binary trees and vectors to store the tournament's knockout rounds and groups. It supports both Round Robin and Single Match formats for group and knockout stages.

Features
Randomized Game Modes: The simulator supports a variety of game modes where teams are randomly allocated to groups and the knockout rounds.

Team Rankings: Teams are ranked based on the latest FIFA international team rankings, adding a realistic touch to the simulation.

Knockout Rounds: The simulator uses binary trees to store and manage the knockout rounds of the tournament.

Group Stages: Vectors are used to store and manage groups of teams, simulating a dynamic group stage with both Round Robin and Single Match formats.

Simulation Options: Customize the simulation by choosing between different match formats and group structures.

Realistic FIFA Integration: Based on the current FIFA international team rankings and historical data, the simulator simulates games accordingly.

Installation
To run the World Cup 2026 Simulator, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, Visual Studio, etc.)

C++17 (or higher) for language features

CMake (optional but recommended for easy project setup)

Steps to Build
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/world-cup-2026-simulator.git
cd world-cup-2026-simulator
Compile the project using g++ or your preferred C++ compiler:

bash
Copy
g++ -std=c++17 -o world_cup_simulator main.cpp
If you are using CMake, follow the instructions below:

Create a build directory:

bash
Copy
mkdir build
cd build
Run CMake to generate the build files:

bash
Copy
cmake ..
Build the project:

bash
Copy
make
Run the program:

bash
Copy
./world_cup_simulator
Usage
Once the project is compiled and executed, the program will simulate the World Cup 2026 tournament. You can customize the simulation by specifying the number of groups, match formats, and whether to use a Round Robin or Single Match format for the group stage.

Command-line Arguments
--groups <number>: Specifies the number of groups (default: 8).

--round-robin: Simulates group stages with a Round Robin format.

--single-match: Simulates group stages with a Single Match format.

--randomize: Randomizes team allocation into groups and knockout rounds.

--seed <number>: Set a custom seed for randomization.

Example:

bash
Copy
./world_cup_simulator --groups 8 --round-robin --randomize
Game Modes
The simulator supports different game modes to simulate various formats of the World Cup tournament:

Round Robin Format
Each team plays against every other team in their group. Points are awarded for wins and draws, and the top teams advance to the knockout rounds based on the points.

Single Match Format
Each team plays one match against each other team in their group. The top teams are determined based on the results of those matches, with tiebreakers as needed.

Knockout Rounds
After the group stages, the tournament enters the knockout rounds, where teams play a single-elimination format. The teams are placed in a binary tree structure to represent the various rounds (e.g., Round of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Final). The winner of each match advances to the next round until the final winner is determined.

Data Structures
Binary Trees for Knockout Rounds
The knockout rounds are represented using binary trees, where each node corresponds to a match, and the winner advances to the next round. This ensures a dynamic and efficient structure for simulating matchups and advancing teams through the tournament.

Vectors for Groups
The groups are managed using vectors in C++, where each group is represented as a vector of teams. Vectors are flexible, allowing us to easily add teams to groups, shuffle them, and handle different group sizes dynamically.

Example Simulation
The following is an example of how the simulator works:

cpp
Copy
// Initialize teams
std::vector<Team> teams = { Team("Team A"), Team("Team B"), Team("Team C"), Team("Team D"), Team("Team E") };

// Allocate teams into groups
std::vector<League> leagues = allocateTeamsIntoGroups(teams, 8, 4, true);

// Simulate knockout rounds
for (const League& league : leagues) {
    // Simulate matches and knockout rounds
    simulateKnockoutRound(league);
}
In this example, the teams are allocated to 8 groups, with 4 teams per group. The simulation progresses to the knockout rounds after the group stages.
